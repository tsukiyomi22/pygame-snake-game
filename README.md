## Description

Welcome to the Pygame Snake Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic snake game using the Pygame library for Python. The game includes basic gameplay mechanics such as generating food, detecting collisions, and managing the snake's movement.

## Features

- **Basic Snake Gameplay**: Start with a snake that moves around the screen.
- **Food Generation**: Randomly generate food which the snake will eat to grow longer.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect when the snake collides with walls or itself, ending the game if necessary.

To install and run the Pygame Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame==1.9.6b
   ```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run the game using Python:

   ```

## Usage Examples

Here's a basic example of how to play the game:

1. Run the game by executing `python main.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
3. Eat the food generated on the screen to make the snake grow longer.
4. Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body; doing so will end the game.
